# CV Application

This project was used to gain a deeper understanding of React props and state through the use of Class components.

This app allows the user to Create/Update/Delete various fields within a template CV layout.

The user can then save as PDF or print using the Chrome print dialog.

Note, data is not saved on refresh.
